# SABINA COMMENT: Overall Feedback

Good stuff:

1. Very well commented code, good names for variables, everything was very easy to read through. Chapeau!

2. You had good intuition in dealing with data in terms of what matters and what doesn't and did a great job on getting from data to insights as quickly as possible. In that sense, this is a textbook example of a quick analysis, so well done on that, I need to learn more from you!

3. Highly appreciate that you already started working on the README and checked videos beforehand. It shows!

To work on:

1. Need a more specific title for this repo and the README. Global Shark Attack Data Analysis doesn't tell me anything about the business you are creating, instead it's quite general. Similarly, `GSAF` tells me even less about what this analysis is!

2. Need a data folder with the raw and processed data. Please check the project brief in the student portal to see how you can structure this.

3. One thing I noticed is that you didn't check the unique values in any of the columns - this is a very important step of data cleaning so make sure to include it going forward. 

P.S. I also left you specific points to work on in the Jupyter notebook. So far, well done and I'm looking forward to the next iteration!
